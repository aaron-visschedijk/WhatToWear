# WhatToWear
WhatToWear is a weather app with a little twist. Instead of displaying abstract numbers like temperature and humidity this app simply tells you what you should wear to be most comfortable.

I created this app mostly as practice to get familliar with Kotlin and the Android ecosystem. It shows some level of profiency using:
- REST api calls using retrofit and moshi
- MVVM architecture
- Android Fragments
- LiveData display
- RecyclerView and Adapter

In the future I would still like to add:
- GPS service to the location for use not restricted to just Copenhagen (lol)
- Add a splash screen while the application is retrieving the data
- Add a setting to make the app adaptable for people that are very heat- or cold-resistant
